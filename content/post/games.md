For the sake of posterity, and for completeness, I am including links to software I wrote in my first (and last) job after graduation. I was hired to write browser-based Java games for [Jagex](http://jagex.com), following the success of their flagship title [Runescape](http://runescape.com).

## [Zombie Dawn](http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=zombiedawn)

This was a launch title commissioned for the unveiling of [FunOrb.com](http://funorb.com) in 2008.

* I based the design broadly on Command & Conquer: Red Alert. 
* This is my favourite piece of software I have ever written, ever.
* Jagex later commissioned two sequels: _Zombie Dawn London_ and _Zombie Dawn Multiplayer_.

## [Pixelate](http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=pixelate)

To detox from long days writing Java, I would play [_Lumines_](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/03/25). 

I got a bit obsessed. My next project was to design a spiritual successor with the same aesthetic idea of transitioning colour and light. The result was a 3D-falling-block game:

* This was the first Jagex game with any kind of real-time multiplayer feedback.
  * (Writing browser applets entirely on TCP streams, not UDP, means that was _really difficult_).
* I was very keen for Pixelate to be unique, not a clone of any existing block game. 
  * The result is fun, but not as much fun as _Lumines_.
* It's possible to master the game with a little effort. We saw users playing perfect (ie. unbeatable) games against each other in head-to-head multiplayer.
