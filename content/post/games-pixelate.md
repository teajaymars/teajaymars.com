> !For the sake of posterity, and for completeness, I am including links to software I wrote in my first job. I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2007 and was hired to write Java browser games to complement [Runescape](http://runescape.com).

## [Pixelate](http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=pixelate)

To detox from long days writing Java, especially in the rush to launch [FunOrb.com](http://funorb.com), I would play [_Lumines_](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/03/25). 

I got a bit obsessed. My next project was to design a spiritual successor with the same aesthetic idea of transitioning colour and light. The result was a 3D-falling-block game:

* This was the first Jagex game with any kind of real-time multiplayer feedback.
  * (Writing browser applets entirely on TCP streams, not UDP, means that was _really difficult_).
* I was very keen for Pixelate to be unique, not a clone of any existing block game. 
  * The result is fun, but not as much fun as _Lumines_.
* It's possible to master the game with a little effort. We saw users playing perfect (ie. unbeatable) games against each other in head-to-head multiplayer.
* As of 2016, the game is still playable if you can get Java to work with your browser.
  * As the service is being wound down, it's unlikely the multiplayer servers will remain online.
