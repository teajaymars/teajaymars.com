My velcro pedalboard kept falling apart in transit to gigs, so I built a much stronger unit with scrap materials. It's secure, very robust, and easy to build.

The "bike chain method" uses rings from an old chain to screw down the pedals.

They're the perfect size for Boss boxes.

Larger pedals need something bigger. Here I've heated and flattened a couple of metal brackets.

Just the right size for the Dunlop Crybaby and the Proco RAT.

Planning the wood slats and the signal chain.

Building a small wooden frame, painting with primer + spraypaint.

Testing it all fits inside the carry case before screwing everything together.

Bonus: Cut a hole in a spring-loaded pick holder to firmly attach it to the board.

[![pedal board stage 13](/img/pedalboard/thumb/13.jpg)](/img/pedalboard/full/13.jpg)

All done! Everything screwed together. Solid as a rock, and won't fall apart in transit.

[![pedal board stage 14](/img/pedalboard/thumb/14.jpg)](/img/pedalboard/full/14.jpg)

Fitted inside the carry case.
