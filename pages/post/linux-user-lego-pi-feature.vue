      Shortly after publishing the
      <a href="/post/lego-xbox-raspberry-pi/">previous article</a> it was picked
      up and republished by Linux User magazine to celebrate the first birthday
      of the Raspberry Pi.

        I think the thing that has really encouraged me is if you actually look
        at the number of these things where the Pi is a tool, it is not the Pi
        itself that is really the hit, it is the thing around it that is really
        the piece of inventive genius.
