When I was a child I always wanted a remote control car. I never got one – usually my parents convinced me that the novelty would wear off in an hour, and that it wouldn’t be worth the expense. (They were probably right). I usually opted for a safer videogame-based option at Christmas time, and on my birthday I’d ask for Lego.

The Raspberry Pi – a tiny, low-power computer that fits in the palm of your hand – provided the inspiration for a project to finally put that right. Using bricks from my childhood Lego collection, and a wireless Xbox 360 controller from my teenage years, at long last I could hack together a remote control car! How hard could it be?

## Not exactly simple

I’m a programmer by trade, but any knowledge of electronics learned during University apparently died at graduation. The necessary software configuration and ~200 lines of Python coding took very little time. The fairly simple circuitry took a _long_ time, and caught fire on several occasions. Your mileage may vary. 

There have been similar attempts to control RC cars from an Xbox controller:

*   [Dan from Chicago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHLnw9Yt1rk) put a Netduino controller on his car which connects via his laptop.
*   [Keegan at jedibowler.com](http://www.jedibowler.com/2011/09/24/controlling-an-rc-car-with-an-xbox-360-controller-via-a-netduino/) used Netduino on the car as well, and has a PC on the floor issuing commands.

This project takes it a step further because the Raspberry Pi is a complete computer, so **all the hardware lives on the car**. There is no need for a laptop issuing commands over Wifi.

## Building the Chassis

The design of the chassis aims to be as simple and robust as possible.

No, really, robustness is key. Some observations:

*   Use Technic clip-joints and axles through everything. 
*   Using Lego studs to join any two parts of the chassis was a waste of effort. Shearing stress pulls them apart easily. 
*   Servos and motors would rather pull the Lego apart than turn the wheels. They need to be very firmly held in place.

Two motors are required:

*   The steering is controlled via a high torque [180 degree Towerpro servo from AdaFruit](http://adafruit.com/products/155). A Lego gear is attached with superglue.
*   The rear axle is attached to a [Lego Power Functions XL-Motor](http://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Power-Functions-XL-Motor-8882). 

<img src="/img/legomotor.jpg" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 10px; float: right;" />
Originally I used an old 9V Technic motor, but it wasn’t strong enough to turn the rear axle. There’s a fascinating [analysis of Lego motors on philohome.com](http://www.philohome.com/motors/motorcomp.htm) which suggests that the newer motor has around 40 times more torque. I purchased one online for just $10.

## Electronics and Soldering

The motors are controlled via PWM (_Pulse Width Modulation_) using the excellent [Adafruit 16-channel PWM driver](http://adafruit.com/products/815).

The [tutorials on Adafruit’s website](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi) are truly exemplary, and in less than an hour I had the Raspberry Pi controlling motor speed and servo rotation.

The above shot demonstrates circuitry mounted onto the chassis.

*   Adafruit’s [Cobbler Breakout Kit](http://adafruit.com/products/914) is used to connect the Raspberry Pi to a prototyping plug-board.
*   The i2c connectors (`SDA0` and `SCL0`, `3v3` and `GND`) are then connected to the PWM driver.
*   GPIO pins `21` and `17` are connected to a cheap [H Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge) chip, specifically the [TB6612FNG from pololu.com](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/713). This will drive the main motor forwards or backwards. 
*   Output `0` on the PWM driver runs into the H Bridge. This controls the main motor’s speed.
*   Output `1` on the PWM driver runs to the steering servo.

## Software

Finally, the Raspberry Pi must be loaded with some software which translates Xbox controller buttons into motor speed, motor direction, and steering rotation.

The [Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000MGVAAQ) is required to connect the controller. Microsoft use a custom wireless protocol, so a regular Bluetooth modem will not work. This bulky device consumes quite a lot of power, but at least it is relatively inexpensive.

“For Windows” should not be taken too seriously. Ingo Ruhnke’s excellent [Xbox/Xbox 360 USB Gamepad Driver for Linux](http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/) is a perfect solution for hooking up the wireless USB device, and it installs in seconds on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu.

At last, I can get back to programming! I hacked together a couple of Python modules to:

*   Run `xboxdrv` as a subprocess, which connects to the controller.
*   Read from the `stdout` pipe as it constantly prints out the controller state.
*   Watch for changes in `LT` (left trigger), `RT` (right trigger) and `X1` (left thumbstick).
*   Update the outputs as appropriate through Adafruit’s libraries.

For example, to control the steering:

{{< highlight python >}}
# Left thumbstick controls the steering
if event.key=='X1':
    steer = int( servoMid + (servoWidth*-event.value)/32768 )
    pwm.setPWM(1, 0, steer)
{{< /highlight >}}

The complete software kit is available in [a repository on Github](http://github.com/zephod/lego-pi).

## Completion

Here’s my DIY-RC-Car in action. Enjoy!
