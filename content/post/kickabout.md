For the sake of posterity, and for completeness, I am including links to software I wrote in my first (and last) job after graduation. I was hired to write browser-based Java games for [Jagex](http://jagex.com), following the success of their flagship title [Runescape](http://runescape.com).

[Kickabout](http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=kickabout) was a highly ambitious multiplayer football game. The goal was to test realtime multiplayer mechanics over TCP - which turns out to be a very tough problem.

* Fortunately, a year after launch the IETF standardised [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), which provides a much more elegant solution.
* Sadly, it means the game quickly became obsolete!

Kickabout took eighteen months to develop, featured an auction house, player customisation, and 4v4 in-browser multiplayer. The game had over **half a million** players and a strong community during the 2010 World Cup.

I led the team, wrote the network code, and handled most of the design. The game is still online and working; it's based on soccer games I used to enjoy on the NES when I was young. 

It's the biggest project I've ever worked on, so there you go: It gets its own page on the site.
