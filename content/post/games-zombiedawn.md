> For the sake of posterity, and for completeness, I am including links to software I wrote in my first job. I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2007 and was hired to write Java browser games to complement [Runescape](http://runescape.com).

## [Zombie Dawn](http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=zombiedawn)

This was a launch title commissioned for the unveiling of [FunOrb.com](http://funorb.com) in 2008.

* I based the design broadly on Command & Conquer: Red Alert. 
* This is my favourite piece of software I have ever written, ever.
* Jagex later commissioned two sequels: _Zombie Dawn London_ and _Zombie Dawn Multiplayer_.
* As of 2016, the game is still playable if you can get Java to work with your browser.
